# vue-todo

To learn more about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), I built 
this todo application. It utilizes [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for the UI.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
